                          Health care coverage: prior authorization. </span></div><div><span id="digesttext"><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the act a crime. Existing law provides for the regulation of disability insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law generally authorizes a health care service plan or disability insurer to use utilization review, under which a licensed physician or a licensed health care professional who is competent to evaluate specific clinical issues may approve, modify, delay, or deny requests for health care services based on medical necessity. For a request prior to or concurrent with the provision of health care services, existing law requires utilization review decisions to be made within 5 business days from the plan’s or insurer’s receipt of the information reasonably
			 necessary and requested by the plan or insurer to make the determination, or within 72 hours if the enrollee or insured faces an imminent and serious threat to their health or the normal timeframe would be detrimental to their life or health, as specified.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would shorten the timeline for prior authorization requests to no more than 48 hours for standard requests or 24 hours for urgent requests from the plan’s or insurer’s receipt of the information reasonably necessary and requested by the plan or insurer to make the determination. Because a willful violation of this provision by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.</div></span></div><span class="hidden"><h2>Digest Key</h2></span><span id="vote">
